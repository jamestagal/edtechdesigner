  "articleBody": "I design and develop educational programs in the LLND (Language Literacy, Numeracy and Digital) department at the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT). I have taught English as a Second Language (ESL) and now EAL (English as an Additional Language) in the AMEP program both at the CIT and AMES in Victoria for over a decade. I have worked as an education designer at CIT in a team, leading the Innovative Learning Resources project as part of CITâ€™s Strategic Compass 2020 initiative. <br><br> My passion for language teaching, eLearning and instructional design and technology has enabled me to develop innovative online courses and resources for a range of education projects with a focus on consistent, functional and bite-size learning design to facilitate learner engagement and rich learning experiences."
