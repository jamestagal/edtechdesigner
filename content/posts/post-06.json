  "<p>I presented on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://h5p.org/\"> H5P Technology</a> at the 2018 EdTechPosium at the Australian Catholic University, Canberra Campus. I illustrated my top 2 H5P content types; Interactive Video and Course Presentation to demonstrate the depth and breadth of this amazing technology. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://h5p.org/interactive-video/\">Interactive Video</a>, allows the author to embed videos and then have quizzes or text responses overlayed at any chosen time in the video. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://h5p.org/presentation\">Course Presentation</a> content type is like PowerPoint but on steroids! It lays out content in a slideshow style format and is the most diverse tool offering around 16 different types of interactions and content. <br></br> <p>All these content types capture students’ interactions and input directly into the Gradebook in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://h5p.org/installation\">Moodle and other LMSs</a>. I also mentioned some <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications\">upcoming content types</a> and features H5P was working on. H5P is now providing its software as a service called which is a fully hosting service for those who want to use H5P for a fee without having to set up and maintain their own website or hosting solution for H5P. I demonstrated how this works from a vendor’s perspective and how <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://h5p.org/documentation/for-authors/h5p-for-moodle-via-lti\">Moodle functions with LTI</a>. In this part, I focused on the power of learner analytics in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://h5p.com/\">H5p.com</a> and how students’ interactive data is collected and presented for teachers.</p>",
